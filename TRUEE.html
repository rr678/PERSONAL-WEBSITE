        <h5>PAINTING</h5>
        <p>When I was a child I dreamed that someday
		I could be a painter but because of lack of resources,
		it hindered me to stop aspiring. Honestly, I don’t have any idea about painting,
		I just wanted to do it. The moment I already had the materials I needed, I couldn't
		stop myself from doing it. Little did I know, while doing it it gives me a relaxation and peace in mind.</p>
